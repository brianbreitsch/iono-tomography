iono-tomography
===============

This package will contain code for generating ionsophere electron density images using TEC observables.

It's current state reflects a work in progress as we discover and implement different algorithms for reconstruction of ionosphere TEC images from sparse observations.

You should execute IPython notebook from this directory to have access to all appropriate files.
